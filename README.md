# MultiMediaViewer
Leverage MPV and some clever screen manipulation to open multiple sources of media at once, and evenly divide the screen into 8 portions for them to fit in. 


NOTE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ensure you change the FILE name in the script to match your file, and keep it in the same directory.

Ensure your screen resolution is 1920x1080p or change the width/height in the script to evenly divide the screen.


TODO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently generates a 2x4 grid based on 8 sources at once, I plan on adding the option to input source number in the future.
